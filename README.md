# GreekMinusculeFont
A repository for a font and accompanying keyboard of the Greek Minuscule Script, based on the 11th-12th c. MS Barocci 102 Manuscript.
**Work in progress**. Will be updated regularly. 

Instructions:
- Download the files
- Install the font (ms_barocci_102/font/msbarocci102.otf)
- Open the Keyman Developer Package (ms_barocci_102/ms_barocci_102.kpj)
- Test the keyboard on Web
  
If the keyboard/package is normally installed and tested (e.g. on Word), there may be issues with ligatures and special characters.
