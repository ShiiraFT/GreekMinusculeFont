# GreekMinusculeFont
A repository for a font and accompanying keyboard of the Greek Minuscule Script, based on the 11th-12th c. MS Barocci 102 Manuscript.
**Work in progress**. Will be updated regularly. 

Instructions:
- Download the files
- Install the font (ms_barocci_102/font/msbarocci102.otf)
- Open the Keyman Developer Package (ms_barocci_102/ms_barocci_102.kpj)
- Test the keyboard on Web

Alternative:
- Install keyboard package (ms_barocci_102/build/ms_barocci_102.kmp)

Keyboard now works on **Word**. The **font** (MS. Barocci 102) has to be selected **manually** and **ligatures** need to be **enabled** for best results.
