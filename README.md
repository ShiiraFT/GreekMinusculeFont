# GreekMinusculeFont
A repository for a font and accompanying keyboard of the Greek Minuscule Script, based on the 11th-12th c. MS. Barocci 102 Manuscript.
**Work in progress**. 
Will be updated regularly. 

Instructions:
- Download the files
- Install the font (ms_barocci_102/font/msbarocci102.otf)

**Option 1**. Test using Keyman App (https://keyman.com/downloads/):
- Install Keyman App
- Install keyboard package (ms_barocci_102/build/ms_barocci_102.kmp)
- Use in word-processing software (Keyboard now works on **Word**. The **font** (MS. Barocci 102) has to be selected **manually** and **ligatures** need to be **enabled** for best results. If a character is inputted that does not exist in the font, Word reverses to a default font. Thus, the MS. Barocci 102 font needs to be **re-selected** manually.)

Or:

- Open the Keyman Developer Package (ms_barocci_102/ms_barocci_102.kpj)
- Test the keyboard on Web

**Option 2**. Alternatively, the font can be used by itself on a word-processing software, using a standard Greek keyboard layout. **However, ligatures and letter variants will not be implementable** (they would have to be manually copied and pasted from the user, from an online repository, e.g. https://jrgraphix.net/r/Unicode/E000-F8FF). 

For **Private Use Area (PUA) Unicode Values** used, as well as **keyboard combinations for ligatures**, see **Greek Minuscule Documentation** (Greek Minuscule Documentation.pdf)
